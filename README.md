Currently not available until it has Terms of Use ready. Please deploy this repo to your own environment and use with your resonsibility.

## How to start?

Start simple by running `yarn watch` (or `npm run watch`, if you set up the project with `npm`). This will start the project with a local development server.

The source files are located in the [`src`](./src) folder. All web components are within the [`src/modules`](./src/modules) folder. The folder hierarchy also represents the naming structure of the web components.

This tool is built with [LWC](https://lwc.dev).
